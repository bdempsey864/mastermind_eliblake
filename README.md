## Welcome to Mastermind! 

Here you will test your skills in logic and strategy to solve a mystery code!
Do you have what it takes to be a Mastermind?

If not, go take a walk.

You have 4 colors to work with. These colors can be repeated or placed in any order. 
Your goal is to figure out, within 10 moves, the correct sequence of those 4 colors.

You will be timed! But, don't worry, that is only so you can see how quickly you 
solved the mystery code.

Good Luck!



## Bugs
1. Any 4 letters can be put in the code. 
2. Win message prints Turn message as well. 
3. Requires "colorized gem" to print colors to terminal as well as run code. (totally worth it)
4. Quit during the game doesn't end program.
